HW 9 - SQL

For this challenge, there were 6 different .csv files containing data. Keys were present in each files so that all 6 files could be connected. The first step was examining the data present in each of the columns of the .csv files. After that, QuickDBD was used to create a schematic diagram, showing how all of the tables were connected and the data present in each table. The schema generated from this diagram was used to create tables in Postgres. Data from each of the .csv files were uploaded to the corresponding table. Once the upload was complete, SQL queries could be run to extract the necessary data for each question.
